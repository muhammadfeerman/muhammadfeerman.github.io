            <p> &nbsp &nbsp Without a doubt, being a highly respected <b>photographer</b> would be my dream career. The type of job that wouldn 't feel like a job because it is one of my favorite hobbies. Growing up I always noticed how much longer I took to take a picture of someone than when they did the same for me. I soon realized that I actually had a passion for getting the right shot that I understood that not every pictures the same and that certain angles made others look better in places.<br></br>
                &nbsp &nbsp 
                Right now Im using Nikon D3500 DSLR for taking any random pictures. Im carrying it whenever Im going out so that I can shoot the scenery of that places. Sometimes when Im
                forgot to bring my camera, Im using my phone camera "iphone 12 Pro Max" which is not bad. The quality of the photos were outstanding considering its only phone camera.
                <br></br>&nbsp &nbsp 
                For the editing, Im usually use Adobe Lightroom, Adobe Photoshop and VSCO. It is a useful software to edit all of my photos taken. The images and video there were
                my sample artwork :-</p>
